# blg - My personal blog platform

This blog platform was built by me for my needs. It's a little rough
around the edges, and I don't expect anyone else to try to use it. But it
gives me great freedom in customizing it, and it was fun to build.

The blog content, such as posts, are not hosted here. You may find the
deployed site over at
[https://blog.larssonoliver.com](https://blog.larssonoliver.com). Hope to
see you there!
